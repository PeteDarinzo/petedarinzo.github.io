Hi, I'm Pete! I am a graduate of the online coding boot camp, Springboard, completing 800+ hours of hands-on course material, with 1:1 industry expert mentor oversight, and completion of 4 portfolio in-depth projects covering front-end web development, back-end web development, and full stack development. 

I am an engineer with a drive to create and test, possessing a varied skill set gained through four years of nuclear submarine design. Strong problem solving skills from working with diverse engineering teams to construct a complex product, and outside vendors to develop submarine components. I have good organizational skills, accountability, and communication developed through regular progress reporting to management and program office. I am a lifelong learner, looking forward to filling a dynamic role in software development.

I have university level experience in object oriented programming, and data structures & algorithms (Java).

Through Springboard, I have skills in Javascript, DOM Manipulation, Git, Ajax, jQuery, Python, Flask, SQL, PostgresQL, Node, Express, React, and Redux, and unit and integration testing.
