## Background
Rainy days and early dark nights on the road made movies a necessity. As a result, I saw some great ones, and new it was a hobby I'd like to continue more after settling back into normal life. 

## Goal 
The question was how could I turn it into an interesting app? The answer: an API mashup! Weatherly used two APIs, one for movie data, and one for, what else, weather. By comparing the upcoming weather to preferences set by the user, Weatherly can return a custom forecast that lets the user knows which days are good for staying in, and which would be better spent outdoors.

## Technologies

Being my second big project, Weatherly was a chance to implement my new knowledge of Node.js and Express servers. I also kicked the user interface up a notch with a React and MUI based front end.
