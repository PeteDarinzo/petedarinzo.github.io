## Background

Life on the road is different from the normal kind. Some days are laid back, some are packed with adventure. Some days, you won't know where you'll be sleeping until the sun starts to set. Or you'll wait until you're hungry to start thinking about where to eat. Also, your home (on wheels) requires just as much maintenance, perhaps more, as your daily driver back home. 

## Goal

That's why I created Green Flash, an road trip assistant for nomads to find local services, document daily life, and keep a record of maintenance done to the vehicle. User's simply input what they're looking for, where they are, and are given results straight from Yelp, including phone numbers and a rating. For more information, the user can navigate to the Yelp page itself, or save the business for later reference. Creating journal and maintenance logs are simple - just give a title, then input the location, date, and mileage. An image is worth a thousand words, user's can add one to the post as well. Looking back on past post's give user's a welcome reminder of where they were on a certain day, or when they're due for an oil change.

## Technologies

The tech stack involved was straightforward - a Python/Flask backend with some Javascript for making Yelp API queries. Styling was done with CSS and Boostrap. Amazon S3 was used for storing images. 

## Features

What is a [green flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash)? Simply put, it's an atmospheric phenomenon in which a setting or rising sun gives off green light. I've never seen one myself, but learned of it from a friend who saw on during a sunset on the West coast of Florida. The name is intended to invoke the feeling of adventure on road trips, and I'm always hopeful that I'll one day see one.
